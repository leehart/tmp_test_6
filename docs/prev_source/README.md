This `docs/prev_source` directory is for RST and `conf.py` "source" files that were used to **manually** build versions of documentation for the `docs/extra` directory.

The RST and `conf.py` "source" files for versions of documentation that were built **automatically** via GitHub Action workflows (e.g. after pushing a new release version tag) do not need to be stored in `docs/prev_source` directory because they will be available via the Git history.
