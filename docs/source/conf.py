# For the full list of built-in configuration values, see the documentation:

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.

import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../..'))

# -- General configuration ---------------------------------------------------
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#general-configuration

# Add any Sphinx extension module names here, as strings. They can be
# extensions coming with Sphinx (named 'sphinx.ext.*') or your custom
# ones.

# List of patterns, relative to source directory, that match files and
# directories to ignore when looking for source files.
# This pattern also affects html_static_path and html_extra_path.

# -- Options for HTML output -------------------------------------------------
# https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html#options-for-html-output

# The theme to use for HTML and HTML Help pages.  See the documentation for
# a list of builtin themes.

# In theory the JSON could be saved in a folder that is listed under your 
# siteâ€™s html_static_path configuration, but this is not recommended. 
# If you want to do it this way, see the Sphinx static path documentation 
# for more information but do so knowing that we do not support this use case.
#
# See https://github.com/pydata/pydata-sphinx-theme/issues/1389
